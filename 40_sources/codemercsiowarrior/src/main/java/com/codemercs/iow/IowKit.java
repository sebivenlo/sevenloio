 * <P>The API of the Java class closely resembles the normal API of the dynamic library.

 * dropped. The class already carries that name so there is no need to repeat it.</P>
 * <P>The type IOWKIT_HANDLE is represented as long. That poses no problem because it is
 * only handed around.</P>
 * <P>With that in mind most of the methods are documented through their API counterparts.
 * No parameter will ever carry values big enough to cause problems with signed versus
 * unsigned values.</P>

	 * <P>For example, writing 0 (all 32 bits are zero) to IO-Warrior sets all pins as outputs driving
	 * low (so if you have LEDs connected to them they will be on).</P>
	 * <P>Reading the status of the pins does always return the logic level on the pins, not the value
	 * written to the pin drivers.</P>
