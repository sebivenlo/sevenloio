        <h1>A set of widgets to create lights and buttons. </h1>
        This is not industrial light and magic, just some simple lights and 
        buttons with various shapes as an exercise in simple widget design.<br/>

        Consider this package as a set of simple examples using Graphics 2d and 
        the Shape hierarchy.

        <p>As an exception to my personal belief that all classes should have
            unit test, this is a case where eye-ball tests are the only adequate
            ones.</p>
